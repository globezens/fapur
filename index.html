      <h1><u>About Purples</u></h1>
      <p>
        Purple is closely associated with violet. In common usage, both refer to
        colors that are between red and blue in hue, but depending on the
        cultural and geographical background of authors and speakers the purples
        may or may not be placed closer to red and violets closer to blue.
        Similarly, in the traditional painters' color wheel, purple and violet
        are both placed between red and blue, with purple closer or not closer
        to red. In the United Kingdom, many native speakers of English refer to
        the blue-dominated spectral color beyond blue as violet, but this color
        is called purple by many speakers in the United States. In some texts
        the term violet refers to any color between red and blue. However, there
        are also authoritative texts from the United Kingdom in which this same
        range of colors is referred to by the term purple. When including
        languages other than English, and epochs other than the modern period,
        the uncertainty about the meanings of the color terms violet and purple
        is even larger. This CIE chromaticity diagram highlights the line of
        purples at its base, running from the violet corner near the left to the
        red corner at the right. In textbooks on optics, violet is often
        considered to be a spectral color: It may then refer to the color of any
        different single wavelength of light on the short wavelength end of the
        visible spectrum, between approximately 380 and 450 nanometers. To some
        native speakers of English, purple is the color of various combinations
        of red, blue, and violet light; to other native speakers of English, the
        same range of colors is referred to as violet .
